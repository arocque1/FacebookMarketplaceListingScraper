# FacebookMarketplaceListingScraper
Facebook bot that web scrapes facebook marketplace for the most recently listed BMW 335d's (although can be used for other cars/items) and emails you if there are any new listings.

If you are using this for yourself, be sure that sender email you use to send emails has 2FA enabled so you can get your app password. Input that in the user input section. Also, if you use this program too much, facebook might ban your account or force CAPTCHA for login, which will break the program. DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM WITH YOUR MAIN FACEBOOK ACCOUNT!
